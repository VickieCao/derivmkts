\title{Perpetual American options}
\usage{
callperpetual(s, k, v, r, d, showbarrier)
putperpetual(s, k, v, r, d, showbarrier)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Price of the underlying asset}

\item{k}{Strike price}

\item{v}{Volatility of the asset price, defined as the annualized
standard deviation of the continuously-compounded return}

\item{r}{Annual continuously-compounded risk-free interest rate}

\item{d}{Dividend yield, annualized, continuously-compounded}

\item{showbarrier}{Boolean (FALSE). If TRUE, the option price and
exercise barrier are returned as a list}
}
\value{
Option price, and optionally the optimal exercise barrier.
}
\description{
\code{callperpetual} and \code{putperpetual} compute
    prices of perpetual American options. The functions optionally
    return the exercise barriers (the prices at which the options
    are optimally exercised).
}
\details{
Returns a scalar or vector of option prices, depending on
the inputs

\code{callperpetual(s, k, v, r, tt, d)}
}
\note{
If the dividend yield is zero, a perpetual call is never
    exercised. The pricing function in this case will return the
    stock price, which is the limiting option price as the dividend
    yield goes to zero.  Similarly, if the risk-free rate is zero,
    a perpetual put is never exercised. The pricing function will
    return the strike price in this case, which is the limiting
    value of the pricing function as the interest rate approaches
    zero.
